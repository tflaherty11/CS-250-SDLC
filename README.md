## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are what the program is supposed solve. This process of implementing user stories into a program can be done by putting yourself in the shoes of the end user. Asking myself "What would you want this program to do if you had the same need that the end user has?" is an effective method of trying to be on the same page as a client. Recognizing the answer to an end user's issue is a critical part of programming.


## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Developing programs can be a very difficult process when you are trying to incorporate an entire project into one line of code. I approach program development as if the goal is to complete several smaller projects. My studies have helped me understand how to incorporate these smaller projects into one big program. Agile has taught me that being on the same page as the rest of my development team and with the end user is a crucial component in this industry. Communication with colleagues is a simple process, but is a requirement in being successful within a development team.


## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team player is not always about applying the best mechanical skill within a program. The components of a good team player is made up in how you integrate a positive work environment within a team and how you use your skills to help build on the vision of a product. The roles of scrum teams vary from scripting code within a program to surveying potential customers. The best development teams find ways to have each role compliment each other, and have a cadence of productivity that isn't impeded by outside influence.
